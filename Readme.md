# IT Job Market Insights ( Germany )

## Overview
This project focuses on extracting, processing, and analyzing job postings from Xing to understand the IT job demand across Germany. The extracted data is cleaned, enriched with geographical details, and visualized using Tableau.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data extraction and cleaning)
- **Requests & BeautifulSoup** (for web scraping and request spoofing)
- **Pandas** (for data processing and cleaning)
- **Fuzzy Matching** (for city name corrections)
- **CSV** (for structured data storage)
- **Tableau** (for data visualization and dashboarding)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)

## Features
- **Job Postings Extraction:** Scraped job postings from Xing using request spoofing.
- **Data Cleaning:** Used fuzzy matching to correct city names and enriched the dataset with latitude, longitude, and state.
- **CSV Export:** Saved extracted and cleaned job data into structured CSV files.
- **Tableau Dashboard:** Created an interactive visualization of IT job demand in Germany.

## Tableau Dashboard
To make the data more accessible and insightful, an interactive Tableau dashboard was created. It provides insights into IT job demand trends, regional distribution, and key job roles.
